### Why are you leaving current job?


*"I’ve truly valued my time at [Current Company], where I’ve grown significantly as a developer and leader—especially while owning end-to-end implementations across the entire codebase. However, after contributing to nearly every module and workflow, I found myself craving new technical challenges and opportunities to solve problems at a larger scale. I’m excited to bring my experience in [mention key skills, e.g., React optimization, team mentorship] to a role that pushes me to innovate and grow further, which is why I’m so interested in this opportunity at [Interviewer’s Company]."*  

### Do you have any questions for us?

Here’s a polished and strategic way to ask about AI/GenAI opportunities while showing enthusiasm for growth:

---

**Interviewer:** *"Do you have any questions for us?"*  

*"Absolutely. I’m particularly excited about how [Company] is adopting AI/GenAI in its product suite. During my tech interview, I learned about [mention a specific AI-related project/tool they use]. As someone actively upskilling in this space—through [mention your learning: courses, POCs, etc.]—I’d love to understand:  
1. How does the company support engineers who want to transition into AI-focused roles?  
2. Are there mentorship programs or internal projects where I could contribute my frontend expertise while collaborating with AI teams?*  

*Long-term, I’d love to bridge my [current skills, e.g., React/Next.js] with AI to build smarter user experiences."*

### **Why This Works**:  
✅ **Shows Initiative**: Highlights your self-driven learning.  
✅ **Strategic**: Positions you as a future-ready candidate.  
✅ **Collaborative**: Focuses on adding value (e.g., "bridge frontend + AI").  

**Tip**: Replace placeholders with specifics from your research about their AI projects.  

Would you like to tweak this for a startup vs. large company context?

### Weaknesses: 
I’ll be honest—sometimes my enthusiasm gets the better of me. When I’m deep in a problem, I tend to overcommit because I want to nail both the functionality and the optimization. That means I might spend extra time refining performance or future-proofing a solution when a simpler approach would’ve worked for the short term. I’ve caught myself burning weekends or late nights perfecting things that could’ve been phased. But I’m actively working on balancing that—now I break tasks into ‘must-have now’ and ‘nice-to-have later’ buckets and communicate timelines more realistically. It’s a work in progress, but I’ve gotten way better at shipping great work without overengineering

### How do you handle stress or tight deadlines?

I stay calm by organizing tasks, maintaining clear communication, and taking short breaks to reset. I focus on what’s controllable, seek support when needed, and use timeboxing to maintain momentum.
