Here are 10 intermediate-level React projects that can be built in about an hour and are commonly asked in technical interviews:

### 1. **Todo List with Local Storage**  
   - Features: Add, delete, and mark tasks as complete.  
   - Persist todos using `localStorage`.  
   - Bonus: Add filtering (All/Active/Completed).  

### 2. **Weather App**  
   - Fetch weather data from an API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).  
   - Display current weather, temperature, and forecast.  
   - Bonus: Add a search bar for different cities.  

### 3. **Quiz App**  
   - Fetch quiz questions from an API (e.g., Open Trivia DB).  
   - Display one question at a time with multiple-choice answers.  
   - Show score at the end.  

### 4. **Movie Search App**  
   - Use OMDB API or TMDB to fetch movies based on user input.  
   - Display movie posters, titles, and ratings.  
   - Bonus: Add a "Favorites" feature.  

### 5. **Expense Tracker**  
   - Add and categorize expenses.  
   - Display a summary (total, chart, etc.).  
   - Bonus: Use `useReducer` for state management.  

### 6. **Pagination Component**  
   - Fetch data from an API (e.g., JSONPlaceholder).  
   - Implement pagination with Previous/Next buttons and page numbers.  
   - Bonus: Dynamic data loading on scroll.  

### 7. **Dark/Light Mode Toggle**  
   - Implement a theme switcher using Context API.  
   - Persist user preference in `localStorage`.  
   - Bonus: Animated toggle switch.  

### 8. **Autocomplete Search**  
   - Fetch suggestions from an API (e.g., GitHub users).  
   - Display dropdown suggestions as the user types.  
   - Bonus: Debounce API calls.  

### 9. **Countdown Timer**  
   - Set a custom countdown time (e.g., 5, 10, 15 minutes).  
   - Show a progress bar or visual indicator.  
   - Bonus: Play sound when timer ends.  

### 10. **Drag-and-Drop Task Board**  
   - Create columns (To Do, In Progress, Done).  
   - Allow dragging tasks between columns (use `react-beautiful-dnd` or `react-dnd`).  
   - Bonus: Save state in `localStorage`.  

These projects test core React concepts like:  
- State management (`useState`, `useReducer`, Context API)  
- API calls (`fetch`, `axios`)  
- Component lifecycle (`useEffect`)  
- User interactions (forms, event handling)  
- Performance optimization (debouncing, memoization)
